Admin:
Your node must be of 'product' type. You can admin
eshop items by clicking on Eshop tab in Node edit page
Here you can add, modify or delete eshop items (prices)

Use:
All items are attached to 'product' type node by plugin behavior,
so you can use it in your controllers or views in array 'EshopItems' in
node data.
For showing item directly add 
<?php echo $this->element('eshop_items_form', array('items' => $node['EshopItems'], 'plugin' => 'eshop')) ?>
to your node view file e.g. /app/views/themed/mytheme/nodes/view_product.ctp
